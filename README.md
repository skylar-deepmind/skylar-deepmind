# 👋 Hello！

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m **skylar-deepmind**, a student with a passion for building, breaking, and fixing things in **Java** (sometimes all at once).

## 🚀 What I’m Up To
- Exploring algorithms and data structures [🔗](https://github.com/skylar-deepmind/DataStructure)
- Decoding design patterns [🔗](https://github.com/skylar-deepmind/DesignPattern)
- Building tools for object detection [🔗](https://github.com/skylar-deepmind/Tools-For-Object-Detection)
- Keeping my head in the clouds [🔗](https://github.com/skylar-deepmind/Head-in-the-clouds)
- Checking out the latest in RT-DETR [🔗](https://github.com/skylar-deepmind/RT-DETR)

## 📚 When Not Coding…
You’ll probably find me lost in a book, searching for new ideas or just a good story.

## 🎉 Fun Facts
- Java is my playground
- I believe every bug is just a misunderstood feature

Thanks for stopping by—feel free to explore my projects or drop a star if you like what you see! 😄
